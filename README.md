# Neurobionics Pi

Reconfigures an official [Raspbian distro](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) to include custom packages, connectivity to a wireless network, and to create a fallback access point when the configured wireless network can't be found, thereby automating the process of setting up a Raspberry Pi for Embedded Research.

# Features
* Uses [CI](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration) (Github Actions) to build a stable Raspbian image that is always up to date.
* Has a feature-rich [web interface](https://docs.raspap.com/), which can be used to modify the networking setup and to run custom scripts.
* Provides a much easier way to build customized project-specific Raspbian images via Github Actions UI.
